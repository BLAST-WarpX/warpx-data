This folder contains collision cross-sections for electron-neutral and
ion-neutral scattering processes that can be used with the MCC routine.

Each cross-section file should consist of exactly 2 columns, the first
containing impact energy in eV and the second the collision cross-section in
m^2. The WarpX MCC routine requires that the values in the energy column be
equally spaced in order for the linear interpolation scheme to work accurately.
