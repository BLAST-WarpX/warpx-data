The origins of the included cross-sections are as follows:
 - electron-impact ionization
   R.K. Janev, J.J. Smith IAEA-APID-4 (1993)
 - ion-impact ionization
   R.K. Janev, W.D. Langer, K. Evans Jr., D.E. Post Jr. H-HE-PLASMA (1987)
- H on H2 ionization: H + H2 -> H+ + e- + H2
   T. Tabata, T. Shirai, Atomic Data and Nuclear Data Tables (2000) https://doi.org/10.1006/adnd.2000.0835 (reaction 31)
   Incoming energies (in the paper) were converted to center-of-mass energies (as expected by WarpX)
